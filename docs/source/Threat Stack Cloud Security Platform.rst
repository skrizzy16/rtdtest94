Vulnerabilities
----------------
Threat Stack Agent retrieves a list of installed packages on the host each day and matches against all known Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVEs) captured in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). It then compares them against the published security notice and triage data from the specific Linux distribution.
