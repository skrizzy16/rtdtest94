Vulnerabilities
----------------
Threat Stack Agent retrieves a list of installed packages on the host each day and matches against all known Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVEs) captured in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). It then compares them against the published security notice and triage data from the specific Linux distribution.

With an Amazon Web Service (AWS) profile integration, the user can see exactly what instances are protected and which are not. The Threat Stack Cloud Security Platformâ“‡ (CSP) will always reflect the current state of your infrastructure through continuous scans for instance creation or termination, etc.

By Selecting, Rules Page, you can review all the included pre-built rules that monitor common threats to any infrastructure. The Base Ruleset has been created by our rules council & SOC team to monitor for the most common attack vectors our experts see on a continuous basis. Due to the complexities of modern infrastructure, we also provide customers with the ability to create custom rules. This provides you with the ability to monitor for behaviors that matter to your unique infrastructure.
